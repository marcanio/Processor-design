We dont flush jr out because we flush the idex regiser but jr happenes in the id stage

Tried to change it by notting with s_IDEX FLUSH but this is bad because jreg sets idexflush to 1. Need to make sure we aren't right after a jump.

s_JregCtrlOut(i) <= ((( s_JumpMuxOut(i) and ((not s_JregCtrl) or s_IDEXControlSigsO(30))) or ( s_RegToA(i) and (s_JregCtrl and not s_IDEXControlSigsO(30))))and not iRST);

addi $7, $0, 2


addi $6, $6, 1
--s
bne $6, $7, loop
--flush
addi $6, $6, 1
==s
bne $6, $7, loop





					 s_IDEXextenMux  when others; why tho
					 
					 
					 
or (s_MEMWBwrAddr = IFIDrt and IFIDImmCtrl ='1' and s_MEMWBwrAddr/="00000" and IType ='0')
or (s_MEMWBwrAddr = IFIDrs and IFIDImmCtrl ='1' and s_MEMWBwrAddr/="00000"and IType ='1')
